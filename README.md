# BoardGameReview

__In this Project we are generating board game review predictions by using a linear regression model and a random forest model.Here we import a data set over 80000 games and then use that information to train both a linear regression model and a random forest model to make predictions based off of board game information.For this project we are using data from [board game geek](https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers/tree/master/boardgamegeek).__
